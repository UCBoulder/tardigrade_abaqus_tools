A stub repository for C++ development projects in W-13.

This repository will contain the necessary setup files to integrate C++ doc
strings, CMake, Doxygen, Sphinx, and Breathe for a complete build system with
integrated documentation. It will also include the necessary hooks to commonly
used C++ libraries for constitutive modeling. Eventually, this stub repository
will include template hooks for integrating C++ code as Abaqus subroutines and
in `EABM`_ repositories for use with the `ECMF`_.

.. note::

   You can use this repo as a stub for fortran projects as well! A
   step-by-step may never happen because c++ is the future of W-13 subroutines.
   For now, refer to the following references:

   * `CMake for Fortran example CMakeLists.txt`_
   * `CMake documentation starting point`_
   * `Stack Overflow thread`_
   * `Doxygen comments for Fortran`_
