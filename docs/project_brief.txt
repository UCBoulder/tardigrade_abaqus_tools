A collection of tools for C++ that make interfacing with Abaqus subroutines easier and less prone to error.

This repository will contain the necessary setup files to integrate C++ doc
strings, `CMake`_, `Doxygen`_, `Sphinx`_, and `Breathe`_ for a complete build
system with integrated documentation. It will also include the necessary hooks
to commonly used C++ libraries for constitutive modeling.
