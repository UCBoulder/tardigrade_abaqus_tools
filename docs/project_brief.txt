A stub repository for C++ development projects in W-13.

This repository will contain the necessary setup files to integrate C++ doc
strings, CMake, Doxygen, Sphinx, and Breathe for a complete build system with
integrated documentation. It will also include the necessary hooks to commonly
used C++ libraries for constitutive modeling. Eventually, this stub repository
will include template hooks for integrating C++ code as Abaqus subroutines and
in
[EABM](https://xcp-confluence.lanl.gov/display/EABM/EABM+Requirements+Document)
repositories for use with the
[ECMF](https://simulia.lanl.gov/ECMF-D/index.html).

> Note: you can use this repo as a stub for fortran projects as well! A
> step-by-step may never happen because c++ is the future of W-13 subroutines.
