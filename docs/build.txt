Build and Test
**************

.. note::

   This is a duplicate of the content found in the README with a manual
   conversion to ReST syntax.

This repository is built with CMake and uses Doxygen + Sphinx + Breathe to build
the documentation.

> **API Health Note**: The sphinx API docs are a work-in-progress. The doxygen
> API is much more useful.

Two build scripts have been created for convenience, ``new_build.sh`` and
``build_docs.sh``. The first will build everything including the library binary,
the test binary, and the documentation. This is the same build script used by
``jenkins_build.sh`` for CI builds and testing. The ``build_docs.sh`` script
only builds the documentation. Both build scripts clobber existing build
directories, reset any bash environment variables, and run the cmake
configuration from scratch.

Build on sstelmo
================

1) Activate the correct python environment

   .. code:: bash

      $ module load python/2019.10-python-3.7
      $ sv3r

2) Build everything and run tests

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/

      # Just perform the build (pick one)
      $ ./new_build.sh <cxx compiler>
      $ ./new_build.sh c++
      $ ./new_build.sh g++
      $ ./new_build.sh icpc

      # Perform tests from PWD
      $ ./build/src/cpp/tests/test_cpp_stub

      # Build and perform tests
      $ ./jenkins_build.sh

3) View test results

   .. code:: bash

      # As built directly to PWD
      $ cat results.tex

      # As built by jenkins_build.sh
      $ cat build/src/cpp/tests/*_results.tex
      $ cat *results.tex

4) Display docs

   .. code:: bash

      # Sphinx
      $ firefox build/docs/sphinx/index.html &

      # Doxygen
      $ firefox build/docs/doxygen/html/index.html &

Building the documentation
==========================

The documentation can be built with ``build_docs.sh``. The steps used in that
shell script are repeated here.

To build just the documentation pick up the steps here:

2) Create the build directory and move there

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/
      $ mkdir build/
      $ cd build/

3) Run cmake3 configuration

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/build/
      $ cmake3 ..

4) Build the docs

   .. code:: bash

      $ cmake3 --build docs

5) Documentation builds to:

   .. code:: bash

      cpp_stub/build/docs/sphinx/index.html

6) Display docs

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/build/
      $ firefox docs/sphinx/index.html &

7) While the Sphinx API is still a WIP, try the doxygen API

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/build/
      $ firefox docs/doxygen/html/index.html &
