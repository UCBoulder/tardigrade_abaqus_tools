Git Commit Message

Begin Git commit messages with one of the following headings:

* BUG: bug fix
* DOC: documentation
* FEAT: feature
* MAINT: maintenance
* TST: tests
* REL: release
* WIP: work-in-progress

For example:

.. code:: bash

   git commit -m "BUG: fixes nasty bug"
   git commit -m "DOC: adds documentation for feature"

Git Branch Names
================

When creating branches use one of the following naming conventions. When in
doubt use ``feature/<description>``.

* bugfix/\<description>
* feature/\<description>
* release/\<description>

reStructured Text
=================

Sphinx reads in docstrings and other special portions of the code as
reStructured text. Developers should follow styles in this [Sphinx style
guide](https://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html#).
