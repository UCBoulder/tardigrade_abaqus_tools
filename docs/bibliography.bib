abstract = {Abstract Expansion of TATB is studied on a molecular level by means of x-ray crystallography. Continuous monitoring of the cell constants of TATB between 214 K and 377 K allows calculation of a volume change of +5.1\% for this molecular system. Expansion of the pure material is almost exclusively a function of a 4\% linear increase in the c axis (the perpendicular distance between sheets of hydrogen-bonded TATB). Calculated from these data, the volume coefficient of thermal expansion for crystalline TATB is 30.4 × 10−5 K−1. The structural features of crystalline TATB and its anisotropic thermal-expansion behaviour are compared with those of graphite and boron nitride. Two other crystalline products in the bulk TATB are either actual polymorphs of TATB or impurities.},

abstract = {Abstract The irreversible volume expansion, or ratchet growth, of TATB and PBX 9502 (95 weight\% TATB) compactions has been quantified over a wide range of thermal cycles. While the precise TATB texture distributions of these specimen sets are likely different from each other, we believe they are consistent within each set, as the expansion data show reproducibility and consistency. These data provide a baseline characterization of the ratchet growth phenomenon in these materials. The increased expansion that comes with changes in the temperature range of the cycles is quantified, repeated hot cycles growing far more than cold. For thermal cycles above ambient where the temperature range is increased in subsequent cycles, the growth of a given cycle is shown to be dictated by previously-established growth trajectories, and the specimen will grow according to the growth potential associated with the temperature range of the present cycle. Alternating hot-cold cycles greatly enhances the cold-cycle contributions as compared to the growth of cold cycles alone. These “rules” of ratchet growth are first established, then observed to hold true for more complex sequences of hot and cold cycles. A simple equation is used to parameterize the response of individual data sets.},

abstractNote = {PBX 9502 has been in war reserve service for over two decades. Ninety-five percent of the solid phase of this insensitive high explosive is composed of energetic crystallites designated as TATB (1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene), held together by the remaining solid fraction--an inert, polymeric binder named Kel-F 800. The unusual combination of extreme insensitivity and adequate performance characteristics is not the only enigmatic feature of such TATB-based materials. In this report, we describe the difficulty and progress to date in reliably determining the coefficients of thermal expansion for consolidated components of PBX 9502. We provide bulk linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) values for PBX 9502 consolidated to a density of approximately 1.890 g/cm{sup 3} and offer a simple set of equations for calculating dimensional changes for temperatures from 218 to 347 K (-55 C to 74 C).},

	abstract = {This paper presents a modeling approach for simulating the anisotropic thermal expansion of polycrystalline (1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene) TATB-based explosives which utilizes microstructural information including the porosity, crystal aspect ratio and processing-induced texture. A self-consistent homogenization procedure is used to relate the macroscopic thermoelastic response to the constitutive behavior of single-crystal TATB. The model includes a representation of the grain aspect ratio, porosity and, crystallographic texture attributed to the consolidation process. A quantitative model is proposed for describing the evolution of the preferred orientation of basal planes in TATB during consolidation and an algorithm constructed for developing a discrete representation of the associated orientation distribution function. Analytical and numerical solutions using this model are shown to produce textures consistent with previous measurements and characterization for isostatically and uniaxially ‘die-pressed’ specimens.

Predicted thermal strain versus temperature results for textured specimens are shown to be in agreement with corresponding experimental measurements. Results from these simulations are used to identify qualitative trends. Key conclusions from this work include the following. Both porosity and grain aspect ratio have an influence on the thermal expansion of polycrystal TATB, considering realistic material variability. The preferred orientation of the single-crystal TATB [0 0 1] poles within a polycrystal gives rise to pronounced anisotropy of the macroscopic thermal expansion. The extent of this preferred orientation depends on the magnitude of the deformation and, consequently, is expected to vary spatially throughout manufactured components much like the porosity. The modeling approach presented here has utility toward bringing spatially variable microstructural features into macroscale system engineering models.}

 abstract = {
            Probabilistic programming allows for automatic Bayesian inference on user-defined probabilistic models. Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complex models. This class of MCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is a tutorial-style introduction to this software package.
